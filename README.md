## MovieRater
A MovieRater app where a user can create and edit movie catalogs.
 
## Motivation
As a person who believes that technology is the major platform for human interaction and socialization, I wish to build a platform where people can interact and communicate their ideas, free from government control.
Before doing so, I wanted to learn about **what** really makes social media platforms so successful and have more hands-on full stack development experience.
<br>As a result, I decided to build this project while following this awesome course: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-django-full-stack/.
